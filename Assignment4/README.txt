The following code is a simple mimicked version of the linux shell. Make sure you have the following files:
'assignment4.c' and 'assignment4.h' for the program to be compiled and executed. Below are steps for execution.

1. Prepare a C runable environment.
2. Compile and run the assignment4.c file.
3. The file will start up a shell with "CSE_320>" as the command line
4. The shell is desiged to execute simple linux commands in the current directory
  - You may as well try commands such as 'ls', 'pwd', 'ps' etc.
5. You can execute more linux commands such as < > redirection and | (pipe)
 - please note that the pipe and redirection command only works once, 
 and more than one usage of such command will result
 in an unexpected behavior
6. The shell will exit with the termination code "exit"
